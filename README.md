# DataInterviewPrepMatcher

Automate matching of data interview preparation participants based on key goals, background and expertise.

## Background

The objective is to automate potential matching of participants for data interview preparation based on details collected via this [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEtHH8QJEFisduwK-g2C8cIm3FMcGxSw_Zn42n3ovj9fJFUQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) and/or Linkedin profiles.  The goal of matching is to try and group people with similar goals and expertise together and ultimately improve efficiency in job interview preparation efforts.  The ideal matching algorithm is potentially a combination of rules based criteria, supervised and NLP modeling.

## Key Tasks

1.  Develop code to insert survey information into database
2.  Develop code that use information in database to generate match recommendations
3.  Create web interface
    a.  Allow people that have signed up to participate to see group recommendations, contact information and basic background (e.g. link to public linkedin profile)
    b.  Allow for opportunity for people to be re-assigned over time.
